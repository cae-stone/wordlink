# Word Link ðŸ§©

A word puzzle game inspired by the New York Times' daily Connections puzzle.

My project goals were to understand the game logic behind Connections and create a engaging single-page web app.  In future, I'd like to explore different ways of making my version of the puzzle more locally relevant and replayable.
